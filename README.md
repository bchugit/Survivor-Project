#### IS620 Final Project
#### Analyzing Social Networks and Predicting Winners in Survivor
##### Brian Chu, Aaron Palumbo - December 2015

Survivor is a reality game show where 16-20 contestants are put in a remote location to compete in challenges and effectively vote each other off one-by-one until a single winner remains. On the surface, the concept of Survivor seems completely unrelated to web analytics. At its core, however, Survivor is effectively a strategic game where success is often determined by building alliances and connections with other players. Therefore, Survivor can be viewed as a social network that actually exemplifies many of the key concepts studied in this course.  
  
In this project, we aim to use social network analysis to answer some of the following:
* What do social networks in Survivor look like (distance, centrality)?
* Is the general gameplay and alliance strategy of Survivor changing over time?
* What is the optimal winning strategy or position in the network?
* Can winners be accurately predicted?
* Who were the best players of all time?
